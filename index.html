                <p class="text">I was born in 1979 in the capital of Armenia, Yerevan. As a child, I loved to play and participate in sports with my friends.
                    <br>I started primary school in 1985, where I studied for 11 years. My favorite subject throughout the years was mathematics. After studying, I served in the Armenian army as a senior sergeant. After coming back from the military,
                    I worked as a waiter in a bar. After some time had passed, I started to work as a coordinator in a public organization that specialized in the protection of rights for car drivers. During this time, I also began to learn 3D modeling
                    for jewelry and worked in this specialty for almost a year. After a year had passed, I received an offer from one of the biggest automotive industries (Toyota) and accepted it with great pride and accomplishment as I loved the automotive
                    industry. I would go on to work there for 10 years. I have learned to speak three languages throughout the course of my life (Armenian, Russian, and English). In 2005, I married the most supportive woman in the world. We have two children,
                    a son, and a daughter. <br>In 2017, I made the decision to search for more opportunity for my family and myself, and thus my family and I moved to the USA. After searching and researching new career opportunities and choices, I took
                    a keen interest in web development and design. It became very fascinating to edit and explore the possiblities of web development and computer coding. I am currently a student learning web development but I have independently created
                    projects to test my abilities. Those projects and other developments can be seen in my portfolio tab. Thank you!</p>
